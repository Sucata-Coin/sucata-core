 * Sell currency for SBR

 * Parameters

 * <li>currency - currency id
 * <li>rateNQT - exchange rate between SBR amount and currency units
 * <li>units - number of units to sell
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * currency sell transaction attempts to match existing exchange offers. When a match is found, the minimum number of units
 * between the number of units offered and the units requested are exchanged at a rate matching the lowest buy offer<br>
 * A single transaction can match multiple buy offers or none.
 * Unlike asset ask order, currency sell is not saved. It's either executed immediately (fully or partially) or not executed
 * at all.
 * For every match between buyer and seller an exchange record is saved, exchange records can be retrieved using the {@link GetExchanges} API
